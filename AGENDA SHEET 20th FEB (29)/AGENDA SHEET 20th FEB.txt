====
Python -->
===
- why to learn python 
- work with numbers
- work with string ( I will explain indepth of the string)
- pyton is object oriented programing 
		object 

syntax to define python variable 
	 (variable name = value )
	 
v = 5 
    v is variable , 5 is value ( number )
	
v1 = 'nit'
	v1 is variable , 'nit' (string) 

always remember you need to call the assigned variable it self 


1- please install software ( share the link please wathc it)
2- we will start code togetaher 

Name error
syntax error

.doc | .xlcx | .pdf

^^^^^^ 26th

i will take the back up class 5 days 
i will share last 4 days recording session 
we just compelte  4 days only
any leanrer who complete ml, pyhton, sql, nlp 

java - 8 line 
c & c# - more line 
python - les snumer of code 

father - who invented python Guido van Rosam
complete monty python's flying circus'' - broadcasted in BBC channel
python 

java 1995 python 1989 -- no one used python at that 
python is more popular when ( ml, data, ) python become popular now 

python has more librar compare to java 

python doesnot works at mobie based application 

write one code in python 
same code can run in winds, linux, mac 

library 
	ml frame - sklearn
	dl frame - tensorflow, keras
	llm frame - langchain, langgrpah
	computer vison -- opencv, yolo, mediapipe
	nlp frame --  nltk, spacy
	data analy - numpy, pandas, plt, sns 
	agentic ai -- phi data, crew ai 
	---
python version 

bigdata and data sciecen -- anaconda python 
i told to install anaconda software -- you already done that 

python version 
	python 1.
	python 2.0
	python 3.0 

software -->
	anaconda -- 
	jupyter
	spyder - ml 
	 vs code
	 colab
	 pychar
	
python introducion -- we completed 

python ide ( integrated development environment)
	using ide one can write the code, fix the erro, excute the programe 
	
using IDE - one can write code, run the code, debug the code
	ide -->
		jupyter
		vs code
		pycharm 

python interpreter 
python compiler 

cpu vs gpu 
local system = personal system -- you install software -- jupyter notebook(cpu) 
google == google machine == using jupyter noteb = google ( gpu)  -- cloud 

execute the code line by line - interpreter 
exeute entire code at once - compiler 

does python is interpreter or compiler == both 

VARIABLE :
	variable name = value
	
a = 5 | a - variable  | 5 - value 
---
Rules to define python variable -->
----
1- variables are case sensitive 
2- variable never start with digit but ends with digit 
3- special symbols are not allowed to define variable only _ is allowed 
4- keyword are never b
	
keyword or reserve words

python function are always ends with ():

variable vs function 

c proga - keywords
java - keyword
python - keyword

if you completed all the keywords ( python complete) 

['False',
 'None',
 'True',
 'and',
 'as',
 'assert',

list slicing --> :

: - entire elment
2:10 --> Print the element from 2nd index to n-1 (10-1) 9th index 
				always right index should be n-1 formula is applicabel 
:10 -->  print the element from starting to n-1 
3: --> print the element from 3rd indext to last index 
1:100:10

1- click the link after i share 
2- click the movie lenght 20m dataset (dataset contain 2cr records) 
3- how to download any dataset from kaggle reposiroaty
	repository -- any one has access easily without any intervanation 
4- extract the datast -- you will get 6 file ( csv) 
5- 2cr records 

1048576 wheare are other recrods ?
we lost some data 

data anlaysis in excel is limited ?
must used some programe sql, python , bi ?

i can work these task in excel why i will go to python or sql ? 
give 2cr records

RAW DATA & CLEAN DATA 


FROM RAW DATA TO CLEAN DATA IS CALLED DATA CLEANING OR DATA CLEANSING

compay has database -- data base (raw data or clean data) 
raw data is there 

data anlayst are the one who convert raw data to clean data ? 
TO DO THESE THEINSG WE NEED TO LEARN CONCEPT CALLED EDA

EDA (EXPLARATORY DATA ANALYSIS)

2 DAY THEORY 
1 DAY PRACTICLE

^^^^^^ 25th
EDA is father & mother of machine learning 
without eda no ml 
no ml no ai 
no ai no gen ai 
no gen ai no agentic ai

=== to complete 6 months ( patience to listen practise)

How to know weather business is fit for apply ml model ?
how to kow dataset is fit for regression or classification model ? based on right dv

HOW TO CHOOSE RIGHT DV ? 
- understand business well ( company will share KT ) knowledge transfer)

task:1 - using python split() -- addre, date, time 

once you do 

task- 
pandas -- we impory only csv file 

.read_csv 

.read_excel
.read_html 
.read_ xml 

can you pull ut any excel , html , xml can you read the data using paandas 
google 

tags seems to refer to a pandas DataFrame or Series.
.isnull() checks for NaN or None values, returning a boolean mask (True where values are missing, False otherwise).

.any() (called once) checks if there’s at least one True value along an axis (e.g., a column or row in a DataFrame).

.any() (called again) reduces the result further, checking if any of those results are True.
So, tags.isnull().any().any() would return:

1- Variable Identification 

	independent variable
	dependent variable 
	relavant attribute
	ir-relavant attribute 

when ever you build any ml project every time try to build model with revant attributeonly 

Never ever build ml model with irrelaveat attribute or else 
MULTICOLLINEARITY OR OVERFITTING problem will happen 


2- univariate analysis - plot the graph using 1 variable is called 


3- BIvariate anlaysis -- plot the graph using 2 variable 

corelation -- The relation between 2 variable is called corelation 
	range of the corelation is -1 to 1 

positive corelation -- range (0 - 1)
negative corelation -- (-1 to 0)
no corelation - range -- 0

If in the dataset all the columne are relavnet then only you will get +Ve corelation 
happily you can build ml model 

We see the graphs for regression & classification 

corelation - relation between 2 varaibel ( sft - price, studen reading - writing) 
regress - dv is continuous
classifcation - dv is binary 

4- OUTLIER Detection 
	datapoint which is very far from other observation 

How to detect outlier -- graph, inter quartile range, z-score


5- missing value treatment  ( how to handle missing value)

dataset (excelsheet) - missing value 

number (Numerical data) - in the dataset if numerical data will missing 
text (categorical data) -- in the dataset if categorical data will missing 

MISSING NUMERICAL DATA 
	mean staretegy 
	median strategy 
	mode strategy 
	
MISSING CATEGORICAL DATA 
	mode strategy 
	nearest neighbour  (k =1 ) 
	
7- VARIABLE CREATION  - new variable will create using transformer or imputation 

6th --> variable imputaion 

imputation technique also called as TRANSFORMER 
convert categorical data to numerical data is called imputeration techniq

		this concept in time series = white noise 

standarization = convert normal distribution to mean-0 & sd - 1 is called or z-score 
	z-score = original value - mean/ sd

eg- mean to 0 & sd - 1 is called z-score | this concept is time series - white noise
	now i am explaining technical theory & practicle we will implement in ml algorithm  this week onwards
===
2- cental limit thorem ( clt)
		no of sampel shoule be > no. of records or no. of observation 
====
3. standard error = sigma / root n
====
4. confidence interval = confidence + interval 

	ipl -- 
		95% confidence that today hyd team will win the match 
		99% confident today bng will the match 
		95% today i will fail the test 
		99% today dad always pay money 
95% confidence -- error 5% | 90 - 10 | 80 - 20

error in statics is called  = alpha 

santa from mumb came to hyderabade ( santa is completel new in hyd)

banta -- cost of the food in hyd ( 50- 300)
	interval has create ( low interval 50 & high inteval is 300)
	
5 & 300 is called - ESTIMATES
avg 5+300/2 called - 152 (ESTIMATOR)

TCS ( tata glucose) sales happen entire world 

records will created 

dataset will create 

tcs statistian ( datasceint)

which regiion has high confident sales 99% 
data scient do you need to compute or not s (tested)

confidence interval = 1- alpha

confidence interval divide into 2 parts
	population CI = POPULATION VARIANCE KNOWN = Z-TEST 
	sample CI  = POPULATION VARAIANCE UNKNOW = T-TEST 
	
Z-TEST | Z-SCORE | Z-TABLE | Z-STATISTICAL TEST 

interview question -- what is statistcal test you have been done in you ml project

resume -- project - technical explanation 

z-score -- is stndarization technique to convert mean - 0, sd - 1 
z-table - z-table is the statistical table whiche helps to comput z-test or z-statistica test 
z-test or z-statistica l-- when the dataset is population we test the dataset using 
						95% confidence interval & 99% confidence interval to finalize range of the dataset 
				
sample -- T-TEST ( T-TABLE)

While we do ML ( everytime we will get T only not Z) 


stats -->
population & sample  
typeof data -- cat (classification) | continuou (regre) | cluser 
descriptive -- mean, me, mo, skew, kur, var, sd,covar
inferential - z-score, standar error, clt, ci, confidence level | 95% & 99% confidence 
			z-test, t-test

advance stats - pending 
stats graphs toward ml --> after that ml chapter 

day after onwards -- ml

HYPOTHESIS TESTING -->
---
statment --> hyd apple fruits are expensive 
hypothesis --> 1 apple cost is 500 
	null hypothesis (H0)
	alternative hypothesis   (H1 or Ha) 
	

your friend will call to 10 friend ( 
10 frien go to all fruit store aveg ( 80 )

mean != 500 (reject the null hypotehsis

H0:M0 != 125 ( reject the null hypothesis means accept the alternative hypothesis)
H1:M1 == 123 ( accept the null hyphthesis)

every time researcher or statician try to reject the null hypothesis

p-value == I will explain in ml multiple linea regression algorithm

p-value > 0.05
